ATHENS_text_recognition
=======================

Team project for the ATHENS image processing course at Telecom ParisTech, dealing with the text recognition from the Google street view pictures.

=====================
To run the code you need to first download or create the dataset. In our work we have chosen images of various characters of 40px X 40px. Particularly our data are originaly from https://www.kaggle.com/c/street-view-getting-started-with-julia/data. After that you need to set the path to your folder containing the training data.

Another step is to select the foder with the picture where the characters should be found.
